## About me
I'm currently a second year student at BSTU "Voenmeh", St. Petersburg. I'm studying at the faculty of Software Engineering. My goal is to become an experienced and in-demand programmer. I'm fond of programming and study new things in this field almost all my free time from studying at the university.

## Code
**Does my number look big in this?** from Codewars: A Narcissistic Number (or Armstrong Number) is a positive number which is the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits in a given base. In this Kata, we will restrict ourselves to decimal (base 10). Your code must return true or false depending upon whether the given number is a Narcissistic number in base 10. 
```
function narcissistic(value) {
  value = value.toString();
  const LENGTH = value.length;
  let sum = 0, i = 0;
  while (i !== LENGTH) {
    sum += Number(value[i++])**LENGTH;
  }
  return String(sum) === value;
}
```
